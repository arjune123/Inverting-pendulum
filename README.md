# Inverting-pendulum
The aim of this project is to acquire a policy for an inverted pendulum model, which will enable it to perform a swing-up movement. In addition to the primary objective of reversing a pendulum's motion, the project's secondary objective is to develop an appreciation for the mechanics of Q-learning. Interestingly the inverted pendulum has a limit on the maximum torque it can apply, therefore it is necessary for the pendulum to do a few "back and forth" motions to be able to reach the inverted position (θ = π) from the standing still non-inverted position (θ = 0).
